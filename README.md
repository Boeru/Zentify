DigiDaruma
======
DigiDaruma is my simple hello world html5 project.

Daruma is regarded as a talisman of good luck to the Japanese and has a design that is rich in symbolism. Daruma dolls are seen as a symbol of perseverance and good luck, making them a popular gift of encouragement.

The goal of this virtual Daruma is to be help many people achieve their personal goals. 

I am working on adding not more than the most important features:

- Choose a color for the Daruma (Different colors for different sorts of goals).
- Color one eye (to make a wish).
- Write down a goal.
- Option to share this goal on Facebook and Twitter.
- Local storage to enable to come back, once the goal is achieved, to color the second eye.



Most important I want to make it a fun and fascinating little web app for people of any given age.
